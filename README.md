# Hang in There  

### Abstract:
Following the project spec/rubric found [here](https://frontend.turing.edu/projects/module-1/hang-in-there-v2.html), we added functionality to a website using JavaScript fundamentals and our knowledge of event listeners and the DOM from the first two weeks of Mod 1. This was also the first time we were able to work firsthand with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to see how they work in synergy to provide structure, style, and dynamic functionality. Users can generate randomized motivational posters from given arrays and even create their own custom posters. In addition to this, users can save any chosen poster to save and display in a CSS grid with the option to double click and remove saved posters as well.

### Installation Instructions:
1) Fork this repository
2) Clone it to your local machine
3) Open and interact with the site using `open index.html` or by using the Live Server Extension on VS Code

### Context:
This project was completed in a 5 day timeline by two Mod 1 students.

### Contributors:

### Learning Goals:
- Write clean, DRY JavaScript
  - Build out functionality using functions that show trends toward SRP
  - Manipulate the page after it has loaded adding, removing, and updating elements on the DOM
- Begin to understand the connection between HTML, CSS and JavaScript
  - Practice reading, understanding, and using provided code
- Build an understanding of writing code collaboratively
  - Document changes with atomic commits & thorough code reviews
  - Communicate, troubleshoot, and plan effectively as a team
  - Ensure all team members are able to be heard and contribute throughout the project
### Wins + Challenges:
Wins:
- We communicated consistently and efficiently via Slack
- We collaborated well together both in pair programming sessions and divide & conquer settings
- We were proactive in reaching out to external resources like MDN docs and our rock mentors when we were stuck

Challenges:
- Despite the fact that MDN docs is an amazing resource when you are reviewing or referencing a concept you already know, it proved to be quite difficult to decipher and understand MDN docs for new concepts we were unfamiliar with and ended up using in the project
- Maintaining a consistent and high standard for our Git workflow proved to be challenging in a group setting. From atomic commits, being intentional about our branches, and wrapping our heads around version control in general, this is something we both would like to keep practicing and improving at.
- It was hard to step back and see the project and its functionality from a bigger picture - especially due to the fact we did not get much exposure to HTML and CSS. Looking back reflectively, it makes sense that both were there to simply act as boilerplate and structure for us to manipulate using JavaScript. Despite that, we both found it difficult to see how they were all working together - especially in the beginning of the project.
